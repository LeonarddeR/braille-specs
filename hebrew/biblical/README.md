# Ancient/Biblical Hebrew braille

## Introduction

Hebrew is a member of the Semitic language family, like Arabic and Aramaic.It has been written for nearly three thousand years, in which time the basic structure has remained stable but much has also changed. Originally, the Hebrew script was an abjad rather than an alphabet, meaning that it contained only consonants. The vowels were inferred with relative ease by native ancient speakers.

Translating consonantal Hebrew into braille is relatively simple. Though Hebrew is written from right to left in visual script, the braille is written left to right like other braille systems. Hebrew has 22 consonants, each of which translates to a single braille cell. Several of these correspond to the same sounds in Hebrew as they do in languages based on the Latin alphabet. For example, the Hebrew letter ג (gimel), which makes the /g/ sound, is represented as ⠛ (dots 1245), ד (dalet),which makes a /d/ sound, as ⠙ (dots 145). However, some letters do not correspond and Hebrew uses sounds not common in European languages, so similar pronunciation cannot be assumed.

Hebrew died out as a spoken language in antiquity, but continued to be used as a religious and liturgical language. In the early medieval period, scribes began adding additional marks to the consonantal text to ensure that the proper pronunciation and recitation would not be lost. There are two categories of these marks: vocalization and cantillation. The vocalization marks are those that guide readers to properly speak (= vocalize) the text. Cantillation marks are those that guide the text's liturgical chanting. All of these marks appear in visual script as formations of dots and lines placed above, beneath, beside, or within the consonants. In Hebrew Braille, the vowels are placed between the consonants. Texts where vowel signs are written are called vocalized.

Accompanying the consonants and vocalization are additional marks called accents or cantillation marks. These guide the traditional chanting of the text. Since several of these mark points of points of disjunction or conjunction in the text, they also serve double duty as punctuation.

In the late 19th century, Hebrew was resurrected as a living language and Modern Hebrew is now spoken and written in Israel and elsewhere. Modern Hebrew grammar differs substantially from classical/biblical Hebrew, but is written with the same consonantal abjad. The use of vowel points is minimal in Modern Hebrew, generally only in cases of ambiguity or likely misreading.

The following specification will follow this three-part division of the characters:
1. Consonants
2. Vocalization (niqqud)
3. Cantillation/accents (ta'amim)

## Consonants

Note: several consonants have multiple pronunciations (similarly to the letter "c" in English). In purely consonantal Hebrew, the pronunciation of these consonants in a given word must be known or inferred from context. In vocalized texts, niqqud clarify the pronunciation. In braille, each pronunciation has its own single-cell braille character, but only in vocalized texts. In consonantal texts, the default is the version without the niqqud. These consonants include:

1. The so-called begakkefat letters (bet, gimel, dalet, kaf, pe, and tav). Each of these letters has a plosive (hard) pronunciation and a spirantized (soft) pronunciation. Their pronunciation in a given word depends on the phonological environment (that is, the sounds that come before and after) and does not affect meaning on its own. IN the visual script, vocalized texts place a dot called a dagesh in the middle of the letter to indicate the plosive pronunciation. Without the dagesh, the pronunciation is spirantized. In antiquity, all six would have been pronounced differently, but In modern pronunciation, usually only bet, kaf, pe, and tav of the begadkefat letters have differentiated pronunciations. Thus, only these four have single-cell braille characters for their appearance with and without the dagesh. In unvocalized texts, the version without dagesh will appear and pronunciation must be inferred. 
2. The letter sin/shin. This letter can be pronounced /s/ or /sh/. When pronounced /s/, it is called sin, and when pronounced /sh/, it is called shin. This distinction does affect meaning, and sin and shin words are listed separately in dictionaries. Unlike the begadkefat letters, there is no indeterminate version of this letter. In use, every one is either a sin or a shin. In vocalized visual Hebrew script, sin is marked by a dot above the left corner (the sin dot), while shin is marked by a dot above the right corner (the shin dot). Since shin is more common, it is considered the default, and the letter with no dot above is translated as a shin. 
3. The letters waw and yod can behave as consonants but also frequently indicate vowels. The same is true, if more rarely, of aleph and he. In these cases, they are referred to as vowel letters (or matres lectionis, Latin for "mothers of reading"). In consonantal texts, this must be inferred from context. In vocalized texts, niqqud indicate pronunciation. In braille, the vowel point + consonant usually translates to a single-cell braille character.

The niqqud points for all of these will be discussed further in the Vocalization section.

### Letter 19: Qof

- ק ⠟ dot 12345

### Letter 20: Resh

- ר ⠗ dot 1235

### Letter 21: Sin/Shin

The letter sin/shin has two pronunciations, /s/ and /sh/. When pronounced /s/ it is called sin, and when pronounced /sh/ it is called shin. In the visual script, 

- The Sin variant has the Sin Dot modifier (ׂ, , \u5C2)
- The Shin variant has the Shin Dot modifier (ׁ, \u5C1)

The undifferenciated variant (Shin without dot) is very rare, only known in the Biblical name יִשָּׂשכָר (Issachar). However, it is necessary for reading unvocalized texts.

The Shin  therefore has two braille forms:

- ש (Sin) ⠱ dot 156
- שׁ (Shin) ⠩ dot 146
Note: These two characters are composed in Unicode of two characters: both the shin character and the differentiating dot. In braille they are contracted when they occur together. 

### Letter 22: Tav

- ת (Tav) ⠹ dot 1456

##Vocalization/Niqqud
Vocalization marks can indicate the pronunciation of a consonant or represent a vowel.

##Daghesh and Mappiq
The daghesh and mappiq are both written as small dots in the center of a consonant. They are both encoded as the same Unicode character (ּ), even though they are grammatically distinct. In braille the mappiq is transcribed differently.

### Daghesh

- Dagesh ⠐ dot 5

In most cases, daghesh appears as a dot 5 preceding the consonant it modifies. 
For the four consonants bet, kaf, pe, and tav, however, it distinguishes between two pronunciations of the same consonant. In braille, the letter with and without daghesh is represented by a different single-cell dot pattern.
- בּ (Bet) ⠃ dot 12, usually constructed of two unicode characters, \u5D1 and \U5BC
- כּ (Kaf) ⠅ dot 13, usually constructed of two unicode characters, \u5DB and \U5BC
- פּ (Pe) ⠏ dot 1234, usually constructed of two unicode characters, \u5E4 and \U5BC
- תּ (Tav) ⠳ dot 1256

###Mappiq

Mappiq only appears with the letter he, and indicates a pronounced /h/ sound
- Mapiq ⠘ dot 45
so הּ = dots 45-125

## Vowels

In visual Hebrew script, vowel points are written around or within the consonants. As Unicode is concerned, they are considered modifiers of the preceding consonant. IN braille, they follow the consonant.

###Basic Vowels

- ָ (Qamats) ⠣ dot 126
- ֳ (Hataf Qamats) ⠜ dot 345
- ַ (Patah) ⠉ dot 14
- ַ (Hataf patah) ⠒ dot 25

- ֵ (Tsere) ⠌ dot 34
- ֶ (Segol) ⠑ dot 15
- ֱ (Hataf Segol) ⠢ dot 26

- ִ (Hiriq) ⠊ dot 24

- ֹ (holam) ⠕ dot 135

- ֻ (Kubuts) ⠥ dot 136

- ְ (Sheva) ⠄ dot 3

  The Sheva indicates that a vowel has disappeared, leaving nothing or a brief fleeting sound.

###Vowel Letters and Full/Malē Spellings

Several of the Hebrew vowels can be written male (pronounced mah-LAY), meaning "full," or haser (pronounced ha-SER) meaning "deficient." Male spellings involve the use of one of the consonants waw or yod to indicate a certain vowel. A consonant used to indicate a vowel is called a vowel letter or mater lectionis (Latin for "mother of reading"). Usually the same word can also be spelled without the vowel letter, in which case it is called haser. Both the male and the haser version of such vowels each have their own single-cell braille character.

Tsere yod

-  ֵי (Tsere yod) dot 3456

Hiriq Yod

-  ִי (Hiriq yod) dot 35

Holam waw

- וֹ (Holam waw) dot 246

Shuruq 

- וּ (Shuruq) ⠬ dot 346

Note: the shuruq is encoded in unicode as a waw with daghesh, as the dagesh and shuruq dot look identical visually. See special cases below.

###example:

Holam: The Hebrew word for "morning," bōqēr, can be spelled consonantally as בקר (haser) or בוקר (male), that is, 1236-12345-1235 or 1236-2456-12345-1235. In the first spelling, the holam is implied. In the second, it is indicated by the waw.

When vocalized, the two versions look like this:

Holam (haser): בֹּקֵר (dots 12-135-12345-34-1235)

Holam waw (male): בּוֹקֵר (dots 12-246-12345-34-1235)

Note: Grammatically, aleph and he can also function as vowel letters, though these do not affect the braille.

##Cantillation and Punctuation

The original IHBC included only a few of the cantillation marks.

- ־ (Maqaf) ⠤ dot 36
(add sof pasuq, atnakh, paseq,; check IHBC intro)

##Special Cases

Sometimes the same characters can indicate different things based on context. In particular, the behavior of waw has two special cases in which its use as a consonant and as a vowel letter must be differentiated.

###Waw with dagesh and shuruq

The shuruq is a vowel letter formed by adding a middle dot to the waw. Sometimes, however, the waw is behaving as a consonant and the middle dot represents a dagesh. The two can be differentiated from context. A shuruq will not be preceded by a vowel, since it represents the vowel attached to the preceding consonant. It will also not have another vowel modifying itself. A waw with dagesh, on the other hand, will be preceded by a vowel and will have another vowel modifying it.
Examples:
Shuruq: עוּר "rouse/waken" (pronounced ʿûr) 1246-346-1235 (⠫⠬⠗).
Waw with dagesh: עִוֵּר "blind" (pronounced ʿivvēr), 1246-24-5-2456-34-1235 (add braille).

###Holam-waw and waw + Holam haser

In vocalized texts, a waw with a holam is usually the vowel letter known as a holam waw (pronounced /ô/). Sometimes, however, it is a consonantal waw followed by a holam haser (pronounced /wo/). There is a special unicode character intended for such cases, called a "holam haser for waw," but it is not always used. Sometimes, a regular holam character modifying a waw should be translated into braille as a holam haser. The two can be differentiated by context, as a holam waw will not be preceded by a consonant with another vowel point, while a waw+holam haser will be.
Some examples should illustrate the point:
Holam-waw: עוֹן (ayin-holam waw-final nun), pronounced ʿôn; 1246-246-1345 (add braille)
Waw+Holam haser (written with "holam haser for waw" character): עֲוֺן (ayin-hataf patach-waw-holam haser-final nun), pronounced ʿăwōn; 1246-25-2456-135-1345
Waw+Holam haser (written with normal holam character): עֲוֹן (ayin-hataf patach-waw-holam haser-final nun), pronounced ʿăwōn; 1246-25-2456-135-1345
Waw followed by Holam-waw: עֲווֹן (ayin-waw-holam waw-final nun), pronounced ʿăwôn; 1246-2456-246-1345

## Unicode modifier ordering

Modifiers like the vowels, dagesh or accents can appear on a consonant in an arbitrary order. Visually, בְּ (Bet Sheva Dagesh) looks equal to בְּ (Bet Dagesh Sheva), but will be read differently by a braille translator. Both should be translated as a Bet with Dagesh and following Sheva (⠃⠄) rather than a bet without dagesh followed by a sheva and a daghesh (⠧⠄⠐) Or any other combination.
This same problem can manifest with any combination of consonant + dagesh + vowel, or with other sequences of consonants and other stacking niqqud.
